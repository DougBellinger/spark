spark
=====

Using jquery to interact with spark.io cores.

https://github.com/DougBellinger/spark/blob/docs/docs/spark%20ui.png

The file spark_jquery.js provides a simple java script object interface to the spark api.

Spark.html uses this interface and the jquery UI to:
- Login
- Retreive devices
- Show the functions and variables for each connected device
- Allow variables to be read and functions to be called.
